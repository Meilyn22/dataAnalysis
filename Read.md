# Overview

This is a simple data analysis program. This program uses Pandas, Seaborn and matplotlib to answer 5 questions about a movie database. I wanted to play a little with the pandas library and showing data in a graph using Python.

The data I used was gotten from Kaggle and [here's a link to the data](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data/version/1).You can also obtain the csv from the folder that this document is in.
